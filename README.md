# Mars

Mars is a web-server with a declarative scripting language. It is planned to be flexible: probable Turing-completeness of the language, the language by itself will be extensible, protocol-agnostic (but HTTP will be the first one and the best supported, of course). The second key feature is performance, which is the primary goal after all.
The project is currently at the early development stage
